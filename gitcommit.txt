#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Added verify form field to addscore.php, which uses capatcha.php as it's src attribute.
Surrounded if loop that checks that the user has entered the required fields in addscore.php, with another iff loop that checks that the verify field matches the captcha image or echoes an error message.
